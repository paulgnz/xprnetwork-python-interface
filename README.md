*Minimalist python library to interact with "XPR Network" blockchain also known as "XPR" or "XPRNetwork"*


</div>

# What is it?
**xprpy** is a python library to interact with XPR Network, an XPR Network.  
Its main focus are server side applications.  
This library is heavily influenced by ÂµEOSIO and forked from FACINGS pyntelope. Many thanks to them for the astonishing job!  


# Main features
- Send transactions
Its main usage today is to send transactions to the blockchain
- Statically typed
This library enforces and verifies types and values.
- Serialization
**xprpy** serializes the transaction before sending to the blockchain. 
- Paralellization
Although python has the [GIL](https://realpython.com/python-gil/) we try to make as easier as possible to paralellize the jobs.  
All data is as immutable and all functions are as pure as we can make them.  


# Stability
This work is in alpha version. That means that we make constant breaking changes to its api.


# Using
## How to Use the `transfer.py` Function

The `transfer.py` script allows you to transfer XPR tokens between accounts via the command line.

### Command-Line Arguments

- `sender`: The account sending the XPR tokens.
- `receiver`: The account receiving the XPR tokens.
- `amount`: The amount of XPR to send (e.g., "55.0000 XPR").
- `--memo`: (Optional) A memo to include with the transaction.
- `--testnet`: (Optional) Use this flag to run the transaction on the XPR Testnet. If not provided, the transaction will be sent to the XPR Mainnet.

### Example Usage

See the examples folder for transfer.py

1. **Transfer on Mainnet:**

   To send 55.0000 XPR from the account `a.babyagi` to `paul` on the XPR Mainnet with an optional memo:

   ```bash
   python transfer.py a.babyagi paul "55.0000 XPR" --memo "Mainnet transaction"

2. **Transfer on Testnet:**

   To send 55.0000 XPR from the account `a.babyagi` to `paul` on the XPR Testnet with an optional memo:

   ```bash
   python transfer.py a.babyagi paul "55.0000 XPR" --memo "Testnet transaction" --testnet


## Use Send Message action
```python
import xprpy


print("Create Transaction")
data=[
    xprpy.Data(
        name="from",
        value=xprpy.types.Name("me.wam"), 
    ),
    xprpy.Data(
        name="message",
         value=xprpy.types.String("hello from xprpy"),
    ),
]

auth = xprpy.Authorization(actor="me.wam", permission="active")

action = xprpy.Action(
    account="me.wam", # this is the contract account
    name="sendmsg", # this is the action name
    data=data,
    authorization=[auth],
)

raw_transaction = xprpy.Transaction(actions=[action])

print("Link transaction to the network")
net = xprpy.XPRTestnet()  # this is an alias for a testnet node
# notice that xprpy returns a new object instead of change in place
linked_transaction = raw_transaction.link(net=net)


print("Sign transaction")
key = "a_very_secret_key"
signed_transaction = linked_transaction.sign(key=key)


print("Send")
resp = signed_transaction.send()

print("Printing the response")
resp_fmt = json.dumps(resp, indent=4)
print(f"Response:\n{resp_fmt}")
```

There are some other examples [here](./examples)


# Known bugs
### multi-byte utf-8 characters can not be serialized
- Serialization of multi-byte utf-8 characters is somewhat unpredictable in the current implementation, therfore any String input containing multi-utf8 byte characters will be blocked for the time being.


# Contributing
All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.  
If you find a bug, just open a issue with a tag "BUG".  
If you want to request a new feature, open an issue with a tag "ENH" (for enhancement).  
If you feel like that our docs could be better, please open one with a tag "DOC".  
Although we have the next few steps already planned, we are happy to receive the community feedback to see where to go from there.  


### Development
If you want to develop for **xprpy**, here are some tips for a local development environment.
We'll be more then happy to receive PRs from the community.
Also we're going full [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and enforcing [pydocstyle](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/) and [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) (with the limitations described in the .flake8 file)

#### Setup
Create a virtual env
Ensure the dependencies are met:
```
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

#### Run tests
The tests are run against a local network.  
Before running the tests you'll need to `docker-compose up` to create the local network, users and contracts used in the tests.  
When ready, just:
```
pytest
```
Some tests are marked as "slow".  
You can skip them and run the test suite faster with:
```
pytest -m "not slow"
```
